# g2h-camera-mods
These steps modify the G2H camera to enable RTSP, telnet, lock a few things down and not to call home.
See wiki for mode info.

# Steps
Clone this repo to the root of an SD card.

Insert the card, power on the camera.

login via telnet --> `telnet G2H_IPADDRESS` (user: `root`, pass: `password`)

The camera will reboot when it's done and remove the SD card. Use at your own risk.
